# ParkCoManageFHE

**ParkCoManageFHE** is an **anonymous urban park co-management platform** that leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to empower citizens to report issues, suggest improvements, and participate in park governance securely and privately. It combines encrypted citizen feedback with FHE-based aggregation and DAO-style decision-making to enhance urban park management.

---

## Project Background

Urban parks are vital public spaces, but traditional management approaches often face several issues:

- **Low citizen participation**: People may hesitate to report problems or suggest changes due to privacy concerns.  
- **Data transparency challenges**: Administrators may receive unverified feedback or skewed reports.  
- **Limited governance engagement**: Citizens rarely have meaningful ways to influence management decisions.  
- **Risk of retaliation or bias**: Feedback can expose personal opinions, discouraging honest reporting.

**ParkCoManageFHE** addresses these challenges through FHE-powered privacy-preserving mechanisms:

- All citizen reports and suggestions are encrypted before submission.  
- Feedback is processed in encrypted form to generate trustworthy summaries and aggregated statistics.  
- Citizens can vote on management proposals anonymously.  
- Administrators and decision-makers only see encrypted-aggregated results, ensuring privacy.

## How FHE is Applied

Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows computations on encrypted citizen input without revealing individual submissions:

- Citizens submit encrypted reports on park conditions, maintenance needs, and improvement suggestions.  
- FHE processes these inputs to generate statistics such as most reported issues, priority suggestions, and voting outcomes.  
- Decision-makers receive aggregate results for informed governance while individual identities and submissions remain confidential.

Benefits:

- **Anonymous civic participation**: Encourages honest reporting and suggestions.  
- **Encrypted processing**: Feedback remains private at all times.  
- **Trustworthy governance**: Aggregated insights are verifiable without compromising privacy.  
- **Community empowerment**: Citizens influence park management without fear of exposure.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Encrypted Issue Reporting**: Citizens report facility issues and maintenance needs securely.  
- **Suggestion Submissions**: Proposals for park improvements are encrypted and submitted for review.  
- **FHE-Based Aggregation**: Generates priority rankings of issues and proposals without exposing individual inputs.  
- **Anonymous Voting**: Community votes on management decisions while remaining fully anonymous.  
- **Dashboard Visualization**: Aggregate insights and trends are displayed for administrators and the community.

### Privacy & Security

- **Client-Side Encryption**: Feedback and votes encrypted before leaving the citizen's device.  
- **Anonymous Participation**: No personal identifiers linked to submissions or votes.  
- **Immutable Logs**: All submissions are stored securely and cannot be altered.  
- **Encrypted Computation**: Aggregation and scoring happen entirely on encrypted data.

## Architecture

### FHE Aggregation Engine

- Receives encrypted reports and suggestions from citizens.  
- Computes aggregate statistics, priority lists, and voting results in encrypted form.  
- Ensures no individual submission is ever revealed.

### DAO Governance Layer

- Uses FHE-processed votes to determine park management decisions.  
- Supports transparent, community-driven governance without exposing individual votes.  
- Facilitates proposal creation, review, and prioritization based on encrypted data.

### Frontend Application

- React + TypeScript interface for submitting reports, suggestions, and votes.  
- Interactive dashboards for viewing aggregated statistics and community-driven decisions.  
- Tailwind CSS for responsive and user-friendly design.  
- Real-time updates on park condition trends and governance outcomes.
